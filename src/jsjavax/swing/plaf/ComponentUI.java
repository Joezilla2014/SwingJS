/**
 * The base class for all UI delegate objects in the Swing pluggable
 * look and feel architecture.  The UI delegate object for a Swing
 * component is responsible for implementing the aspects of the
 * component that depend on the look and feel.
 * The <code>JComponent</code> class
 * invokes methods from this class in order to delegate operations
 * (painting, layout calculations, etc.) that may vary depending on the
 * look and feel installed.  <b>Client programs should not invoke methods
 * on this class directly.</b>
 * 
 * To create a new UI in SwingJS:
 * 
 * 1) Add to the JXxxx.java constructor a call to updateUI();
 * 
 * 2) Add to Jxxxx.java the static uiClassID field
 * 
 *      private static final String uiClassID = "XxxxUI";
 *
 * 3) Add the following three classes:
 * 
 *   public void setUI(MenuItemUI ui) {
 *       super.setUI(ui);
 *   }
 *
 *	public void updateUI() {
 *       setUI((XxxxUI)UIManager.getUI(this));
 *   }
 *   
 *	public String getUIClassID() {
 *       return uiClassID;
 *   }
 *  
 * 4) In jsjavax.swing.plaf, create the interface XxxxUI.java
 *    
 * 5) In swingjs.plaf, create JSXxxxUI.java modeled after similar classes
 * 
 *
