/**
 * 
 * A minimal implementation of AudioSystem for SwingJS
 * 
 * The <code>AudioSystem</code> class acts as the entry point to the
 * sampled-audio system resources. This class lets you query and access the
 * mixers that are installed on the system. <code>AudioSystem</code> includes a
 * number of methods for converting audio data between different formats, and
 * for translating between audio files and streams. It also provides a method
 * for obtaining a <code>{@link Line}</code> directly from the
 * <code>AudioSystem</code> without dealing explicitly with mixers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Properties can be used to specify the default mixer for specific line types.
 * Both system properties and a properties file are considered. In the Sun
 * reference implementation, the properties file is
 * &quot;lib/sound.properties&quot; in the JRE directory. If a property exists
 * both as a system property and in the properties file, the system property
 * takes precedence. If none is specified, a suitable default is chosen among
 * the available devices. The syntax of the properties file is specified in
 * {@link java.util.Properties#load(InputStream) Properties.load}. The following
 * table lists the available property keys and which methods consider them:
 * 
 * <table border=0>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Property Key</th>
 * <th>Interface</th>
 * <th>Affected Method(s)</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>javax.sound.sampled.Clip</code></td>
 * <td>{@link Clip}</td>
 * <td>{@link #getLine}, {@link #getClip}</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>javax.sound.sampled.Port</code></td>
 * <td>{@link Port}</td>
 * <td>{@link #getLine}</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine</code></td>
 * <td>{@link SourceDataLine}</td>
 * <td>{@link #getLine}, {@link #getSourceDataLine}</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>javax.sound.sampled.TargetDataLine</code></td>
 * <td>{@link TargetDataLine}</td>
 * <td>{@link #getLine}, {@link #getTargetDataLine}</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * 
 * The property value consists of the provider class name and the mixer name,
 * separated by the hash mark (&quot;#&quot;). The provider class name is the
 * fully-qualified name of a concrete
 * {@link javax.sound.sampled.spi.MixerProvider mixer provider} class. The mixer
 * name is matched against the <code>String</code> returned by the
 * <code>getName</code> method of <code>Mixer.Info</code>. Either the class
 * name, or the mixer name may be omitted. If only the class name is specified,
 * the trailing hash mark is optional.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the provider class is specified, and it can be successully retrieved from
 * the installed providers, the list of <code>Mixer.Info</code> objects is
 * retrieved from the provider. Otherwise, or when these mixers do not provide a
 * subsequent match, the list is retrieved from {@link #getMixerInfo} to contain
 * all available <code>Mixer.Info</code> objects.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a mixer name is specified, the resulting list of <code>Mixer.Info</code>
 * objects is searched: the first one with a matching name, and whose
 * <code>Mixer</code> provides the respective line interface, will be returned.
 * If no matching <code>Mixer.Info</code> object is found, or the mixer name is
 * not specified, the first mixer from the resulting list, which provides the
 * respective line interface, will be returned.
 * 
 * For example, the property <code>javax.sound.sampled.Clip</code> with a value
 * <code>&quot;com.sun.media.sound.MixerProvider#SunClip&quot;</code> will have
 * the following consequences when <code>getLine</code> is called requesting a
 * <code>Clip</code> instance: if the class
 * <code>com.sun.media.sound.MixerProvider</code> exists in the list of
 * installed mixer providers, the first <code>Clip</code> from the first mixer
 * with name <code>&quot;SunClip&quot;</code> will be returned. If it cannot be
 * found, the first <code>Clip</code> from the first mixer of the specified
 * provider will be returned, regardless of name. If there is none, the first
 * <code>Clip</code> from the first <code>Mixer</code> with name
 * <code>&quot;SunClip&quot;</code> in the list of all mixers (as returned by
 * <code>getMixerInfo</code>) will be returned, or, if not found, the first
 * <code>Clip</code> of the first <code>Mixer</code>that can be found in the
 * list of all mixers is returned. If that fails, too, an
 * <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> is thrown.
