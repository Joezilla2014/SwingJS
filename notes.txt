todo: ZIP tools integration from JSmol into SwingJS 
  -- java.util.zip classes almost certainly do not work in SwingJS

combining JSmol and SwingJS applications on one page:

 -- need to allow more than one package.js and designation of that in Info
    -- for now just created a specialized concatenation
 -- need to integrate corejmol.z.js with coreswingjs.z.js
    -- a simple copy \b did work, but that is crazy inefficient
 -- perhaps create a distribution that does this
 
 see Bob's local c:\temp\swingjs.2015.11.09_jmolswingjs\t.htm for an example
